🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow by building and evaluating a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using a structured dataset.
It covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.

📌 Project Objective

To implement a House Price Prediction system using Linear Regression and understand the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from raw data to model evaluation.
